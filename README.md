AWS Security Hub and AWS Config are valuable services for monitoring and managing the security and compliance of your AWS resources. However, AWS Audit Manager serves a specific purpose related to audit and compliance assessment management, and it can complement these other services in the following ways:

Compliance Assessment Automation: AWS Audit Manager is designed specifically for conducting compliance assessments. It automates the collection of evidence, assessment creation, and reporting for various compliance standards and frameworks. While AWS Config and AWS Security Hub provide configuration and security monitoring, AWS Audit Manager streamlines the compliance audit process.

Assessment Workflow: AWS Audit Manager offers a workflow for assigning roles and responsibilities in the compliance assessment process. This can help streamline the auditing process, especially in larger organizations where multiple stakeholders are involved in compliance assessments.

Assessment Reporting: AWS Audit Manager provides specific compliance assessment reporting capabilities, allowing you to generate reports that demonstrate your compliance with specific regulatory standards and industry frameworks. This can be useful for audits and compliance reporting.

Custom Controls: While AWS Config and AWS Security Hub provide a set of predefined controls, AWS Audit Manager allows you to create custom controls tailored to your organization's specific compliance requirements. This flexibility can be valuable for addressing unique compliance needs.

Centralized Evidence Repository: AWS Audit Manager provides a centralized repository for storing and managing evidence collected during compliance assessments. This can make it easier to organize and access audit evidence when needed.

In summary, AWS Audit Manager is primarily focused on compliance assessment and management, offering features and automation specific to that purpose. If your organization has stringent compliance requirements, needs to perform regular compliance audits, or wants to streamline the compliance assessment process, AWS Audit Manager can be a valuable addition to your AWS compliance toolkit, even if you are already using AWS Security Hub and AWS Config.

Ultimately, whether you need AWS Audit Manager depends on your organization's compliance objectives, the complexity of your compliance requirements, and your preference for streamlining the compliance auditing process. You may choose to use all three services together to achieve comprehensive compliance management within your AWS environment.
